To loop an array - for..each
TO transform an array - array.map()
TO remove elements from an array = filter()
To turn array into a single element = reduce()
If 1 element exists in array - some()
If array includes that array - include()

Create an array  =  let array = [];
Add to an array = array.push('a');
Remove last elemet = array.pop()
Remove 3rd element from an array - array.slice(2,1)
Replace element of an array - arra[3] = 'e'
Get reference to 3rd array = array[1]

What is an Array:
==================

Array is a list of items where order matters.
Arrays can be of any size
Array represents a reference to things not the things itself.
Array points to numbers and strings.
Copies are made of them when referenced.
JS Arrays are referred to as array like objects.
Can be accessed in consistent order.
JS Arrays represent a list of reference to things.
Arrays hold reference to objects.

Referring to Array Elements:
============================

let arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5];
array[0] // 1
array[2]// 3


Can be added using push
can be added in middle using splice
All elements can be added to another using concat.
Elements can be remove using splice.


Iterating arrays:
==============

for loop
for..each loop

Filter:
======
* Used to remove multiple elements from an array
* Just like Air filter
* creates a copy of an array

Map:
====
Used to transform each element of an array in the same way
can turn array of objects into array of strings
creates a copy of an array
same no of elements as original

Reduce:
======

Take all elements of an array and reduce it to single element
Reduce an array of number to sum of numbers
Boil soup till we get single serving


Some and Every:
=============

Turn entire array into true or false

Function passed to every or some which determines an array element passes is called predicate

every() - true for every element
some() - true for one or more elements


Inclues:
========

true if the element of array matches the passed element
